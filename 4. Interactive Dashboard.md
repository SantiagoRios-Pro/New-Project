### 1. Asset Class Allocation

The portfolio is diversified across four major asset classes:
- **31% Equity** (dominated by large-cap stocks)
- **25% Alternatives**
- **25% Fixed Income**
- **17% Commodities**

This indicates a fairly balanced portfolio, with a slight preference toward large-cap equity. The inclusion of fixed income and alternatives reflects a moderate risk tolerance, aiming to blend growth with stability.

### 2. Rate of Return Over Time

Returns have shown wide swings, with most values clustering between -0.2 and +0.2. There are frequent periods of negative returns and volatility, which could be driven by macroeconomic conditions or poor asset performance. This highlights the need for a risk management strategy to minimize losses during turbulent market phases.

### 3. Asset Value Trends

Overall portfolio value trended upward until late 2021, after which it began to decline slightly. Certain assets like **PANW** have performed very well, which explains why the 24-month return remains positive, even though the 12- and 18-month returns are negative.

This suggests there's still value in the portfolio, but itâ€™s being carried by a few strong performers. Underperforming assets may need to be reviewed and replaced.

### 4. Risk vs. Return

The scatter plot in the dashboard shows that:
- Some assets are **high risk, low return**, which is not ideal.
- Others offer **high return for relatively low risk**, representing high performers.

Fixed income assets, in particular, have shown a poor risk-return profile. This underperformance appears consistently across the rate of return and asset value charts, suggesting itâ€™s time to explore alternatives.
