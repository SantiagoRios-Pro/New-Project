# ðŸ“Š Recommendations Summary

Paul's current portfolio shows a mix of strong performers and assets that are either too risky or not delivering sufficient returns. Below is a breakdown of the key insights and recommended adjustments based on our dashboard analysis and SQL findings.

---

### Portfolio Adjustments

Paulâ€™s portfolio contains 67 tickers, but several of them show high risk with very low or even negative returns. One example 
is **CNBS**, which consistently underperforms while maintaining high volatility. As we saw earlier, assets like **PFIX** offer 
much stronger performance with better risk-adjusted returns.

Given the downward trend in returns over the past 12, 18, and 24 months, it's a good time to rethink the strategy and rebalance
the portfolio. 

## Actionable Investment Recommendations

Based on both the dashboard and SQL results, here are specific asset substitutions to consider:

| Current Asset | Asset Class   | Issue                                                                 | Recommended Replacement | Sharpe Ratio |
|---------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| **EOPS**      | Alternatives   | [Lowest return in its class](#eops)                                   | **PFIX**                 | 0.76         |
| **CNBS**      | Commodities    | [Highest risk + lowest return](#cnbs)                                 | **MSOS**                 | 0.57         |
| **GM**        | Equity         | [High risk + near-zero return](#gm)                                   | **SNOW**                 | 0.61         |
| **TLT**       | Fixed Income   | [High risk + lowest return](#tlt)                                     | **AGG**                  | 0.45         |


These suggested replacements have strong Sharpe ratios, meaning they deliver more return per unit of risk. They also 
help Paul maintain diversification while improving overall portfolio performance.

By making these updates, Paul can:
- Reduce exposure to underperforming assets
- Improve average returns
- Stay within a low-to-moderate risk profile
- Align the portfolio more closely with current market conditions

These changes are backed by both quantitative analysis (via SQL) and visual validation in the dashboard. The tools
weâ€™ve used give us a clear direction for optimization.
