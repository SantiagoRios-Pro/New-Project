# Portfolio Analysis for Client Paul Bistre

---


<a name="part-1"></a>

## Step 1 - Data Exploration

### Assumptions

* **21 trading days per month** – all monthly and multi‑month calculations assume 21 trading days.
* **Pricing source** – daily closing prices stored in the `invest.prices` table.
* **Client identifier** – `client_id = 148`.

<a name="step-2"></a>

### Step 1 – Create a Client Specific View

The following view consolidates Paul Bistre’s holdings into a single structure that powers every query in Step 2.

```sql
USE Invest; -- database with all clients

CREATE VIEW paul_bistre_portfolio_view AS
SELECT
    sm.ticker,
    sm.security_name,
    sm.major_asset_class,
    sm.minor_asset_class,
    sm.sec_type,
    pd.price_type,
    pd.value,
    hc.quantity,
    pd.value * hc.quantity AS total_value, -- calculates the total value invested in the asset
    pd.date
FROM account_dim AS ad
JOIN holdings_current AS hc USING(account_id)
JOIN pricing_daily_new AS pd USING(ticker)
JOIN security_masterlist AS sm USING(ticker)
WHERE
    pd.price_type = 'adjusted' -- to use only this type of price as discussed in class
    AND ad.client_id = 148     -- filters only for data regarding Paul Bistre
    AND pd.date >= '2020-09-09'; -- gives us the data for the last 24 months;
```

> **Why a view?**

Using a view in our analysis makes the process much more efficient, especially since the full dataset is large and running queries with multiple joins can take a lot of time and computing power. The view helps by keeping everything we need in one place, so we don’t have to repeat the same joins in every step. It also makes sure we’re always looking at data specific to the client, and it keeps our analysis consistent and easy to reproduce later on.

**Getting to know Paul's portfolio**

In how many assets has our client invested during the last two years?
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ticker) AS ticker_count
FROM paul_bistre_portfolio_view;
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3079e3e5-2dc9-4269-b385-ecf48eed324e)

It looks like Paul’s portfolio has held 67 different assets, but that’s a bit too broad on its own. To get a clearer picture, I need to take a closer look at the types of assets he’s invested in. Let’s examine how many asset classes are represented and how these are distributed across his portfolio.

```sql
SELECT
    major_asset_class,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ticker) AS num_tickers
FROM paul_bistre_portfolio_view
GROUP BY major_asset_class
ORDER BY num_tickers DESC;   -- highest-to-lowest
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e673e963-0559-4705-877e-9cfb0b3a4453)

Paul’s portfolio looks fairly well-diversified, with investments spread across equities, fixed income, alternatives, and commodities. However, it looks like “fixed income” was entered in two different formats, so we’ll clean that up in Tableau to ensure a clearer view when we build the dashboard later on. Overall, this kind of distribution suggests a balanced approach, probably for an investor trying to reduce risk while still taking advantage of different types of opportunities in the market.

Now let's look at the minor classes in Paul's portfolio.

```sql
SELECT
    minor_asset_class,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ticker) AS num_tickers
FROM paul_bistre_portfolio_view
GROUP BY minor_asset_class
ORDER BY num_tickers DESC;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4fccc60-76e9-4c5d-9798-0b298890b25a)

Paul’s portfolio holds 67 tickers in total, but only 34 of them are labeled with a specific minor asset class. That means 33 tickers don’t have a classification, likely due to missing or inconsistent data. Ideally, we would clean this up to improve filtering and analysis when building the dashboard. However, since we’re working directly in MySQL, it's best practice not to modify the source data here. If we were conducting this analysis in a tool like Python or R, where changes wouldn’t affect the original database, we could safely clean the data. In this case, we'll proceed with the null values as they are.

From the tickers that are classified, we can see a strong focus on large-cap investments (19 tickers), which points to a strategy centered around stable, well-established companies. The rest are spread across more specialized areas like precious metals, cannabis, gold, and oil, with a few in carbon and fixed income categories like corporate bonds and investment-grade corporate bonds.

## Step 2 – Business Task

> All queries reference `invest.paul_bistre_portfolio_view`.

### Analysis 1 – Multi‑Period Returns 
* Business Question: What are the returns for each security (and the overall portfolio) over the most recent 12, 18, and 24 months?

First, I will start by calculating the trailing 12‑, 18‑, and 24‑month total return for each security as follows:

```sql
SELECT
    ticker,
    AVG(r.ror_12m) AS avg_return_12_months,
    AVG(r.ror_18m) AS avg_return_18_months,
    AVG(r.ror_24m) AS avg_return_24_months
FROM (
    SELECT 
        z.*,
        (z.value - z.p0_12m) / z.p0_12m AS ror_12m,  -- To calculate rate of return
        (z.value - z.p0_18m) / z.p0_18m AS ror_18m,  
        (z.value - z.p0_24m) / z.p0_24m AS ror_24m   
    FROM (
        SELECT *,
            LAG(value, 252) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date) AS p0_12m, -- 12 months (252 trading days)
            LAG(value, 378) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date) AS p0_18m, -- 18 months (378 trading days)
            LAG(value, 504) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date) AS p0_24m  -- 24 months (504 trading days)
        FROM invest.paul_bistre_portfolio_view
    ) AS z
) AS r
WHERE date = '2022-09-09'  -- To get data from most recent day
GROUP BY ticker; -- To get values per security
```

This graph, which is part of our dashboard, helps illustrate the appreciation of these assets over time. When comparing their values on 03/09/2021 to those on 09/09/2022, the increase is clear.

24 months →  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2b1a8c5-721e-4940-a56b-37c6636cf36f)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbf23ec3-d30f-4aa3-b260-24aba7fdefd7)

This graph, which is part of our dashboard, helps illustrate the appreciation of these assets over time. When comparing their values on 09/09/2020 to those on 09/09/2022, the increase is clear.

I will now calculate the trailing 12‑, 18‑, and 24‑month total return for the overall portfolio.

```sql
SELECT 
    AVG((value - p12) / p12) AS avg_return_12_months,
    AVG((value - p18) / p18) AS avg_return_18_months,
    AVG((value - p24) / p24) AS avg_return_24_months
FROM (
    SELECT 
        value,
        LAG(value, 252) OVER(PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date) AS p12,
        LAG(value, 378) OVER(PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date) AS p18,
        LAG(value, 504) OVER(PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date) AS p24,
        date
    FROM invest.paul_bistre_portfolio_view
) AS sub
WHERE date = '2022-09-09'
;
```

#### Insights

These queries helped us evaluate individual asset performance and overall portfolio returns over 12, 18, and 24 months. Over the past 12 months, the portfolio experienced a 4.7% decline, despite strong gains from assets like UNG (59%), PFIX (56%), and CNC (48%). Similarly, the 18-month return showed a smaller decline of 1.5%, with top performers including UNG (179%), PANW (64%), and NVO (56%). In contrast, the 24-month analysis revealed an 8.4% overall gain, led by PANW (136%), UNG (118%), and PFG (101%).

These results suggest that while some assets have consistently performed well, others have significantly underperformed, especially in the more recent periods. The positive long-term trend contrasts with the short-term declines, signaling a potential shift in performance momentum. This emphasizes the need for a review of the current asset allocation and investment strategies to address recent underperformance and ensure the portfolio stays aligned with long-term growth objectives.

### Analysis 2 – One‑Year Sigma & Average Daily Return
* Business Question: What is the risk (sigma) for each security over the last 12 months? What are the average daily returns?

```sql
WITH average_daily_return AS (
    SELECT
        ticker,
        date,
        (value - LAG(value) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date)) /
        LAG(value) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date) AS average_daily_return  -- To obtain daily rates
    FROM invest.paul_bistre_portfolio_view
    WHERE date >= '2021-09-09'  -- To get data for the last year
)

SELECT
    ticker,
    average_daily_return,
    STD(average_daily_return) AS risk          -- Standard deviation of daily returns
FROM average_daily_return
WHERE average_daily_return IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ticker;                               -- Get one value per security
```

#### Insights

This query provides the average daily rate of return and the corresponding risk for each asset in the client’s portfolio, based on the past 12 months of data. The sorted results show that several assets like UNG, SVIX or ROST carry high risk while delivering low or negative returns, highlighting the need to reassess and potentially replace these investments with ones that offer stronger performance.

In addition, the visualization suggests that the client’s overall risk tolerance falls in the low to moderate range. Most assets are clustered in the low-risk zone, which supports this observation. When we combine this with the client’s current asset allocation, 17% in commodities, 25% in alternatives, 25% in fixed income, and 31% in equities, it further confirms Paul’s preference for a conservative to moderately conservative investment strategy.

### Analysis 3 – Risk‑Adjusted Returns
* Business Question: Which security stands out as the top performer based on risk-adjusted returns, and why?

```sql
SELECT
    ticker,
    AVG(ror) AS avg_ror,
    STD(ror) AS std_ror,
    AVG(ror) / STD(ror) AS adjusted_risk
FROM (
    SELECT
        z.ticker,
        z.date,
        z.value,
        z.p0,
        (z.value - z.p0) / z.p0 AS ror  -- To calculate rate of return
    FROM (
        SELECT
            ticker,
            date,
            AVG(value) AS value,
            LAG(AVG(value), 252) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date) AS p0  -- To obtain rates for the last year
        FROM invest.paul_bistre_portfolio_view  -- To use the entire dataset, not only the holdings from Paul
        GROUP BY ticker, date
    ) AS z
    WHERE z.p0 IS NOT NULL
) AS r
GROUP BY ticker -- To get values per security
ORDER BY adjusted_risk DESC;  
```

#### Insights

To answer the question, we calculated the risk-adjusted return for each security using the formula:
AVG(returns for ticker) / STD(returns for ticker). This formula is a simplified version of the Sharpe Ratio, a common financial metric that evaluates how much return an investment generates relative to its risk (volatility). When the risk-free rate is assumed to be zero, the Sharpe Ratio simplifies to average return divided by standard deviation, exactly what this formula represents.

The SQL code first computes the daily rate of return for each ticker using lagged price values, then calculates the average return and standard deviation over the past 12 months. Finally, it divides the average return by its standard deviation to obtain the risk-adjusted return for each asset.

Based on this analysis, the security with the highest risk-adjusted return is LBAY, meaning it delivers the greatest return per unit of risk taken. It is followed by RINF and KO, which also show strong performance relative to their risk levels. These assets stand out because they generated higher returns while maintaining relatively low volatility, making them more efficient investment options within our client's portfolio.

### Analysis 4 – Proposed New Investment
* Business Question: Recommend a new investment to include in the portfolio. What would it be, and how much additional risk (sigma) would it introduce?

```sql
SELECT
    ticker,
    AVG(ror) AS avg_ror,
    STD(ror) AS std_ror,
    AVG(ror) / STD(ror) AS adjusted_risk
FROM (
    SELECT
        z.ticker,
        z.date,
        z.value,
        z.p0,
        (z.value - z.p0) / z.p0 AS ror  -- To calculate rate of return
    FROM (
        SELECT
            ticker,
            date,
            AVG(value) AS value,
            LAG(AVG(value), 252) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date) AS p0  -- To obtain rates for the last year
        FROM invest.pricing_daily_new  -- To use the entire dataset, not only the holdings from Paul
        GROUP BY ticker, date
    ) AS z
    WHERE z.p0 IS NOT NULL
) AS r
GROUP BY ticker;  -- To get values per security
```

**Recommended security:** `PFIX` (Simplify Interest Rate Hedge ETF)

This query is identical to the one used in the previous question, but it analyzes data for all tickers in the invest dataset, not just those currently held in Paul’s portfolio. That’s why we use the pricing_daily_new table instead of the view created in Step 1. This broader approach allows us to evaluate which assets could offer the most efficient returns relative to their level of risk.

#### Insights

Based on the results, I would recommend adding the ETF with the ticker PFIX to Paul’s portfolio. PFIX has the highest risk-adjusted return (0.76) among all assets analyzed, meaning it offers the best return relative to the amount of risk involved. This makes it a highly efficient investment option.

For Paul, who aims to maximize returns while maintaining a moderate risk profile, PFIX aligns well with his goals. Its standard deviation (3.72) reflects moderate volatility, and its adjusted risk is superior to some of the existing holdings in the portfolio, such as COF (0.54) and CNBS (0.46). Incorporating PFIX could strengthen the overall return potential of the portfolio without significantly increasing its risk.
