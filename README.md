# CLient Specific Performance for and Investments Firm

### Business Task
The goal of this project is to analyze the performance of one of the firms' clients portfolio (Paul Bistro, with client_id = 148)

The 4 business objectives are the following:
* What are the most recent 12 months, 18 months, 24 months return for each of the securities (and for his entire portfolio)?
* What is the most recent 12 months sigma (risk) for each of the securities? What is the average daily return for each of the securities?
* Which of the securities is best from the rest (with highest risk adjusted returns), why?
* Suggest adding a new investment to your portfolio - what would it be and how much risk (sigma) would it add to your client?
