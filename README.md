### ðŸŽ¯ Business Task
This project focuses on analyzing the investment performance of one specific client at the firm, Paul Bistro (`client_id = 148`).

The analysis is guided by the following four business objectives:
* What are the returns for each security (and the overall portfolio) over the most recent 12, 18, and 24 months?
* What is the risk (sigma) for each security over the last 12 months? What are the average daily returns?
* Which security stands out as the top performer based on risk-adjusted returns, and why?
* Recommend a new investment to include in the portfolio. What would it be, and how much additional risk (sigma) would it introduce?
